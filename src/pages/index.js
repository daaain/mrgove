    <h3>Why did we make this video?</h3>
    <p>
      In November 2017, Michael Gove, Environment Secretary,{' '}
      <a
        target="_blank"
        href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/09/the-evidence-points-in-one-direction-we-must-ban-neonicotinoids"
      >
        pledged
      </a>{' '}
      to prevent the use of a group of pesticides known as neonicotinoids. A
      restriction on their use had been placed on them by the EU in 2013 but,
      with Brexit and possible US trade deal deregulation ahead, we wanted to
      remind Mr Gove of his promise to care for the environment and to leave the
      pesticide controls in place.
